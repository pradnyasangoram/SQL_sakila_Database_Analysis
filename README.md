# SQL_sakila_Database_Analysis

The Sakila database is a nicely normalised schema modelling a DVD rental store, 
featuring things like films, actors, film-actor relationships, and a central inventory table that connects films, stores, and rentals.


The main goal of this project is to understand the following:

1. Analyze use behavior
2. Make data-driven decisions
3. Measure and track marketing efforts
4. Find actionable customer/business insights
